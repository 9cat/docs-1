**Timestamp**
    A timestamp is the time when a given transaction completed being processed.  When a transaction is first made, its timestamp will display as "unconfirmed".  Once the transaction has completed successfully it will display as a date and time.  **Note**:  For large transactions, you should always wait for them to be confirmed before considering them to be complete!

**Address**
    For incoming transactions this column displays the address of the person or entity that sent you the coins.  For outgoing transactions this column displays the address to which the coins were sent.

**Amount**
    This column displays the amount of bitcoins transfered.  It is negative in the case of outgoing transactions.

**Balance**
    This column shows the total number of bitcoins in your account after the transaction completed.

If you click on a transaction in the Transactions list you will see a list of links to third party services which can provide you with more information about the transaction.
