Signing messages
================

Signing messages is used to prove ownership of the current wallet. Typically when you have your wallet address registered on exchange websites and protected with 2FA and you loose access to your 2FA. If you want to prove you are the owner of the current wallet, you can use signed message to do so.

In order to sign message, go to the account page in myTREZOR and press Sign & Verify in the right top corner.  You should see a payment page like this:

**2. Confirm the signature on your TREZOR**

Once you have press "Sign" button, you will be asked to confirm the signature.  Check the text of the message.  If the text is correct, press the right button on your TREZOR to confirm.  If it is wrong, press 'cancel'.  If it is wrong, it may mean that your computer has been infected with a virus and you can be happy that your bitcoins are safe in your TREZOR, and not already stolen.
