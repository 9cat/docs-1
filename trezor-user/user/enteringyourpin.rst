Entering your pin
========

You can use your TREZOR safely with any computer even one you don't trust.  But you don't want to go entering your PIN into untrusted computers and ATMs.  The TREZOR doesn't make you enter your pin directly into your computer and its therefor much more secure than the credit card you're used to.  But its also a little bit more complex.

Don't worry though, its not that hard and once you get the hang of it you'll be using truely military grade security.

If you look down at your TREZOR you'll see a grid filled with numbers not to different from the grid of questions marks on your screen.

Now that you've entered your pin you can move on to :doc:`Filling out your recovery card <fillingoutyourrecoverycard>`.
