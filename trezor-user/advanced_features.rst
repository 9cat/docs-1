Advanced TREZOR features
========================

Using multiple accounts
-----------------------

Your TREZOR can manage multiple bitcoin accounts.  This allows for easier tracking of bank balances and for managing your bitcoin identity.  All bitcoin transactions are publicly available on the internet.  It is not, however, public who controls a given bitcoin account.  If you want to keep some of your transactions private, then you will need to manage multiple accounts.  A common account separation would be to have three accounts:

 - personal use
 - business use
 - private purchases

If you frequently send bitcoins between accounts then it may become clear that you are the owner of both.  For this reason, we consider this privacy feature to be useful mainly to advanced users.

Creating a new account is easy.  Just press the add account button at the bottom of your accounts list:

.. note:: The add account button will be disabled until you have sent some bitcoins to your last account.
