Filling out your recovery card
========

If you have set your new pin successfully you will now see a message on your TREZOR's screen promping you to write down the seed.

Your seed is a list of secret set of words that you will use to recover your money incase you ever lose your TREZOR.

Now you should get out the recovery card that came with your TREZOR and fill out the blanks with the words you see on your screen.

To go to the next word press the right button on the device.

Once you have written down the secret words in your seed you will find yourself at the beginning of the list again.  As you procede through the list of seed words for the second time, check them against your recovery card to ensure that you have filled out your recovery card correctly.

Once you have done so, you're ready to start using your TREZOR device!
