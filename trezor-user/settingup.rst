Setting up your TREZOR device
=============================

The TREZOR works with almost any computer that has a USB port and an internet connection.  To install the TREZOR drivers go to |myTrezor|.  You should see a page with a Download link.  Download the TREZOR software and follow the instructions on the screen.

Once you've got the TREZOR driver installed go to |myTrezor| again.  This time you should see a web page welcoming you and asking for a device label:

.. note:: There are also several :doc:`advanced settings <advanced_settings>` that you can configure.

.. You don't need to use the |myTrezor| webservice if you want to use your TREZOR device.  You can use any bitcoin software that supports TEZOR including:

 - Electrum
 - Multibit
