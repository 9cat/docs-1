Hardware Design & Security
==========================

What does TREZOR look like?
---------------------------

You can have a preview of what TREZOR is going to look like in our `TREZOR Timeline gallery <http://www.bitcointrezor.com/news/trezor-timeline>`_. The Classic will be having the same shapes and size as the Metallic, but different casing material.

What are the technical parameters of the case?
----------------------------------------------

Both TREZOR Classic and TREZOR Metallic will have a similar case with dimensions of approx. 59 x 30 x 6 mm. The Classic edition is made of a reinforced plastic providing a great durability. The Metallic TREZOR is made of a polished aluminum with a CNC milling method.

What is inside of TREZOR?
-------------------------

TREZOR is using a 120 MHz embedded ARM processor (Cortex M3 to be precise) with a custom developed system.

Why does TREZOR not have a fingerprint reader?
----------------------------------------------

We believe adding a biometric finger scanner to the device would decrease its security. There are ways to `hack the fingerprint reader already <http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/22/apple-iphone-fingerprint-scanner-hacked>`_.

Is the case protected against opening before delivered to me?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, the case will be in a bag sealed by a security hologram sticker which would get damaged if somebody tries to remove it. Before starting to use the device please make sure the sticker is not damaged.

Is the display of TREZOR big enough to show the entire address?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, the display is an OLED with 128x64 pixels, big and bright enough to show clearly the entire payment address.

Which case colors of TREZOR Classic are available?
--------------------------------------------------

At this moment we are offering the Classic TREZOR in dark grey color. If possible we will introduce more colors in the future.

What if my computer that runs my bitcoin wallet is stolen?
----------------------------------------------------------

If your computer gets stolen, just plug your TREZOR to another computer and you'll get your account balance and transaction history. Might your TREZOR get lost as well, simply recover the seed from your paper backup to a new TREZOR device or a TREZOR compatible wallet software.

Is it safe to get TREZOR through the airport check?
---------------------------------------------------

Yes, TREZOR is just as any other type of common electronics, so no harm should be done by X-raying it.

Is TREZOR heat & cold resistant?
--------------------------------

Yes, but we advise you not to expose TREZOR to temperatures lower than -20°C or higher than +60°C (-4F +140F).
