Crowdfunding & Pricing
======================

Why should I support this project with my bitcoin(s)?
-----------------------------------------------------

Because what we are trying to do is unique and very much needed. There are `numerous reports of bitcoin losses <https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=83794.0>`_ and with rising popularity bitcoin will be getting more attractive to thieves.

We believe TREZOR is the solution to the risks of loss and theft of bitcoins (and litecoins) and at the same time a tangible wallet that can make it easier for common people to use and understand bitcoins.

In return for your early adopter contribution you will receive one of the very first devices and some advantages for the future that others won’t have.

Are there other ways to support you guys?
-----------------------------------------

Sure, we are grateful for any support, be it from the heart by spreading the word to the Bitcoin community, writing articles about TREZOR or by sending the amount of your choice to our donation address 1BitkeyP2nDd5oa647AjvBbbwST54W5Zmx.

Do you accept fiat money for TREZOR?
------------------------------------

Because we want to support the Bitcoin economy, we only accept bitcoins as means of payment for TREZOR. We also pay a significant part of the production in bitcoins.

Do you accept investment proposals or issue shares?
---------------------------------------------------

No. We want to keep the project independent and that’s why we have decided to do a crowdfunding. Instead of issuing shares, we will allow our early supporters to participate on our success by earning bitcoins from referral sales.

Why does the TREZOR Metallic cost 2 BTC more than the Classic edition?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s due to the high cost of aluminum case produced by CNC milling.
