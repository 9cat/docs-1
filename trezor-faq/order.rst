Order & Delivery
================

How does Pre-Order of TREZOR work?
----------------------------------

Pre-Order allows you to participate on the development of the device and be among the first TREZOR owners when produced. Select one of the TREZOR editions, specify the amount of devices and fill-in your delivery address.

How can I purchase different TREZOR editions?
---------------------------------------------

Select the wished amount of one TREZOR edition, click „Add to cart“ and then „Back to eshop“ and specify the amount of the other edition.

For those who have ordered two editions before we launched the shopping cart, we'll definitely try to combine them together and treat as one order while shipping.

Besides ordering TREZOR, can I support the project otherwise?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Sure, we are grateful for any support, be it from the heart by spreading the word to the Bitcoin community or by sending the amount of your choice to our donation address 1BitkeyP2nDd5oa647AjvBbbwST54W5Zmx.

How will I know if my Pre-Order went through?
---------------------------------------------

Once you have submitted a Pre-Order, you will receive a confirmation email informing you that the Pre-Order was successful. The email includes payment instructions.

How will you know that I have actually made the payment?
--------------------------------------------------------

Each order is associated with a unique payment address.

How do I pay for my pre-ordered TREZOR?
---------------------------------------

Your payment instructions will be included in the confirmation email sent to you after submitting the Pre-Order. Your payment has to be validated by the Bitcoin network within 48 hours after placing the order.

I have paid but I received a cancellation of my order.
------------------------------------------------------

If the payment has less than 6 confirmations within 48 hours, it will be cancelled automatically.

Might that happen even if you have paid, please alarm us at info@bitcointrezor.com and we will verify your payment manually.

How do I know when my TREZOR is shipped?
----------------------------------------

You can follow the status of your order via your TREZOR Account which has been created after your payment. Also, when your device is shipped, we will notify you by email. Please note that the estimated delivery dates might change. We are doing our best to be able to send you your TREZOR as soon as possible.

Can I change my pre-order before I made the payment?
----------------------------------------------------

If you wish to change the quantity or editions of TREZOR before having it paid, please make a new pre-order and leave the first one unpaid. Each unpaid order or unverified payment will be cancelled automatically 48 hours from the time of placing the order.

When will you start shipping TREZOR?
------------------------------------

The originally estimated November for Classics and October for Metallics has been postponed to January. Please read our news on the update.

Can I change my pre-order after the payment was done?
-----------------------------------------------------

If you wish to add new TREZOR devices, simply create new order and enter the same delivery address. We'll try to match your orders together and send one package only. In the pre-order stage we do not handle refunds.

Can I choose the delivery service?
----------------------------------

Not at the moment. We might introduce this in the future.

What will be in the package?
----------------------------

Your TREZOR will be delivered with a micro USB cable and a user manual.

How do you send TREZOR to me?
-----------------------------

We are shipping TREZOR to the mailing address provided in your pre-order by the best available postal company by a standard shipping (no priority). Please note that the delivery dates might vary depending on your location and other conditions out of our control. The shipping for our early supporters is already included in the price of TREZOR, so no additional costs for you.

What are the shipping costs to my country?
------------------------------------------

For early supporters of our project the shipping will be free of charge. Later we will introduce standard shipping and priority shipping that will be charged on top of the product price.

Is shipment to my country available?
------------------------------------

You can check the list of countries of delivery in the Pre-Order Form. If your country is not listed, let us know at info@bitcointrezor.com. We will try to enlarge the list of countries as soon as possible.

How do I claim a refund?
------------------------

In the Pre-Order stage we do not handle refunds. A refund will be possible in case of TREZOR not being shipped at all.

Can you deliver multiple orders to one address?
-----------------------------------------------

Yes.

How long does it take to deliver my package?
--------------------------------------------

It heavily depends on the distance and your local postal service. The delivery might take as much as 2 days up to several weeks. We will try to estimate the delivery time in the shipping confirmation we send to you.

Can I change the delivery address before the package is shipped?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can change your address before we start shipping in your TREZOR Account.
