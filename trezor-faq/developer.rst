Developer's Corner
==================

I want to participate on implementing TREZOR with my wallet or service.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

We will be happy talking to you, please contact us at info@bitcointrezor.com.

Is it possible to flash the device?
-----------------------------------

Yes, it is. Devices sold by us have an USB bootloader that allows firmware flashing. Upon start the firmware signature is checked and if it does not match ours a warning is issued. User can continue on his own risk after pressing the button. This small inconvenience is to increase the security of the end users.

Where can I find the source code?
---------------------------------

Some of the sources are at `Github <http://github.com/trezor/>`_. We are in the process of finalizing and cleaning up the sources and preparing a security audit of the code. We will publish the sources before shipping TREZOR to our customers. We will notify our `newsletter subscribers <http://www.bitcointrezor.com/>`_ once this is done.
