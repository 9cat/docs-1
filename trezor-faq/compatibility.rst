Compatibility of TREZOR
=======================

Which operating systems does TREZOR work with?
----------------------------------------------

TREZOR is Windows, MacOS and Linux friendly. But it works with any operating system which supports USB HID.

Which Bitcoin wallets are TREZOR compatible?
--------------------------------------------

As of today, we are working on integrating TREZOR to MultiBit, Electrum, Armory, Blockchain.info and some others. We plan to introduce a simple TREZOR web wallet to ensure you can always have some simple payment option even if using a computer owned by somebody else. We also plan to include more software wallets support in near future. If your preferred wallet is not mentioned, please consider using one of the above or let us know your suggestions at info@bitcointrezor.com.

Can I use TREZOR with my mobile device (phone or a tablet)?
-----------------------------------------------------------

In case your mobile device supports USB OTG (USB host) there is no reason why you couldnâ€™t use TREZOR with it, other than that there is not application that supports TREZOR. At this moment, we are concentrating on adapting TREZOR for desktop and web wallets.

Can I sign text with TREZOR?
----------------------------

Yes, it has signing features compatible with Bitcoin-Qt so you can use TREZOR for signing messages as well.

Does TREZOR support multiple wallets?
-------------------------------------

We have considered a multi-wallet support, but it goes against our motto - make it now and make it easy. A multi-wallet support would be making the device more complicated for usage (the wallet won't be recognized automatically when plugged into computer). However we might consider this in the future for the advanced product versions.

Does TREZOR support transactions on online sites like coinbase or blockchain.info?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, we are working on a solution that will address these online services.

Is TREZOR compatible with other virtual currencies (like Litecoin, Namecoin etc.?)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently TREZOR supports Bitcoin and Litecoin. Since we are keeping TREZOR implementation agnostic, it should be possible to enlarge the scope to other significant alt-coins n the future.
