Compatibility of TREZOR
=======================

Which operating systems does TREZOR work with?
----------------------------------------------

TREZOR is Windows, MacOS and Linux friendly. It works with any operating system which supports USB HID.

Which Bitcoin wallets are TREZOR compatible?
--------------------------------------------

As of today you can use just myTREZOR web wallet. We are working on integrating TREZOR to desktop wallets such as MultiBit, Armory, and others. We plan to include support for more wallets in the near future.  If your preferred wallet is not mentioned, please ask its developers to include support for TREZOR.

Can I use TREZOR with my mobile device (phone or a tablet)?
-----------------------------------------------------------

In case your mobile device supports USB OTG (USB host) there is no reason why you couldn't use TREZOR with it, other than that there is not application that supports TREZOR. At this moment, we are concentrating on adapting TREZOR for desktop and web wallets.

Can I sign text with TREZOR?
----------------------------

Yes, it has signing features compatible with Bitcoin-Qt so you can use TREZOR for signing messages as well.

Does TREZOR support transactions on online sites like coinbase or blockchain.info?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not at the moment, but we are working on a solution that will address these online services and allow them to easily support TREZOR.

Is TREZOR compatible with other virtual currencies (like Litecoin, Namecoin etc.?)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since we are keeping TREZOR coin agnostic, TREZOR is altcoin friendly. The only problematic part of the infrastructure is altcoin backend that supports TREZOR wallet format or at least deterministic wallets. Ask your altcoin developers if they are supporting TREZOR or if they will support it in the near future.
