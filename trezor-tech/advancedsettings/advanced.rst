Advanced TREZOR settings
-------------------------------------

There are several advanced settings that can be configured while setting up your TREZOR device.  For the most part, these settings can be accessed by pressing the "Advanced features" button right after you have plugged your TREZOR in for the first time or after whipping the device.
