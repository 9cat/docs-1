Disabling PIN protection
-------------------------

myTREZOR.com will ask you for your PIN the first time you try to make a transaction after plugging in your TREZOR.  PIN protection reduces the risk that a person with physical access to your TREZOR device will be able to steal your bitcoins.  The TREZOR PIN works in such a way that even the computer you use with your TREZOR never finds out your PIN.  It is possible to disable PIN protection by unchecking the "enable pin protection" checkbox.  Even if you have configured a passphrase for your TREZOR DO NOT DISABLE PIN PROTECTION!
